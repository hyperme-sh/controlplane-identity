# controlplane-identity

Shared internal-token comparison, person/portal permissions, API-key and Keycloak
validation, purpose-bound sessions, and Base wallet proof verification.
See [configuration and verification behavior](docs/identity.md).

## Development

Requires Python 3.13+ and uv 0.11.26:

```sh
bash scripts/check-package.sh
```

The script runs locked source tests, builds wheel/sdist distributions, verifies
all runtime files in both wheels, and repeats the tests in a fresh environment
outside the checkout against the wheel and an sdist-rebuilt wheel.
No service checkout, private dependency or credential is needed.

Wallet tests use mocked RPC responses. They do not establish live Base or validator
acceptance. Integration with service configuration and separately owned legacy
`api.*` aliases requires consumer integration checks.

Public module contracts are recorded in `contracts/identity.json`. Package version
and public-contract version are separate. Review contract compatibility when
changing public modules, session scope or wallet-verification behavior.

CI runs the same checks on isolated GitHub-hosted Ubuntu workers for pull requests,
main and manual runs. It uses read-only contents and pinned actions, with no
service secrets or deployment credentials.
